Docs, notes, and miscellany in exploring the possibility for making GSCPC data free and open

## Real-life examples where open data could have helped

- A realtor wanted to use the [NRCS soil survey tool](http://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx). That tool is pretty cool because it lets you upload a shapefile of an area of interest and then returns a nifty map and report based on whatever data they have and you filter for that area. If we did a little training on how to use QGIS and had our data openly available, she could likely have done this herself.
